# `@tmnl/mantis-assistant`

A0 pin and compatibility harness for the mantis assistant. Mastra is the
agent runtime. CopilotKit/AG-UI is the protocol surface. This package is not
the keeper PWA, not a SpecimenDB bridge, and not a shop-release, EVA, or graph
claim. Mastra memory is not canonical care or evidence truth.

Beta Mastra APIs are imported only through `src/mastra-adapter.ts`. A surface
that cannot be pinned and proven is marked `QUARANTINED_UPSTREAM`. Live
observational-memory observer/reflector cycles on InMemoryStore are quarantined;
thread OM config and privacy typing are proven.

## Pins

See `src/pins.ts` and this directory's `package-lock.json`.

## Commands

```text
npm ci
npm test
npm run typecheck
```

Tests use the committed lock, a fake model, fake tools, a fake clock, and
in-memory storage. They do not use live credentials or network model providers.
